# Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This notebook attempts to replicate the results of the style transfer algorithm outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) using Pytorch. The paper proposes a method to blend the artistic style of one image with the object content of another, thus effectively transfering the style of one image onto another image.
